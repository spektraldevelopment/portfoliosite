          any other factor beyond Sponsor’s reasonable control impairs the integrity or
          proper functioning of the Grand Prize Drawing or Poll Predictor Game, as determined
          by Sponsor in its sole discretion and subject to the approval of the Régie des
          alcools, des courses et des jeux. Sponsor reserves the right in its sole
          discretion to disqualify any individual it finds to be tampering with the entry
          process or the operation of the Grand Prize Drawing or Poll Predictor Game or
          to be acting in violation of these Official Rules or any other promotion or in
          an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to
          deliberately undermine the legitimate operation of the Grand Prize Drawing or
          the Poll Predictor Game may be a violation of criminal and civil law, and,
          should such an attempt be made, Sponsor reserves the right to seek damages from
          any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. Sponsor’s failure to
          enforce any term of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that
          provision. </span></p>
